Two classes:  
1. acute myeloid leukemia (AML): 25 samples  
2. acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): 47 samples

# Small round blue cell tumors (SRBCT)  
Study (Khan et al.): http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/microarray/nm0601_673.pdf

SRBCTs are 4 different childhood tumors “so named because of their similar appearance on routine histology, which makes correct clinical diagnosis extremely challenging. However, accurate diagnosis is essential because the treatment options, responses to therapy and prognoses vary widely depending on the diagnosis.”

Four classes:  
1. Ewing's sarcoma (EWS): 29 samples  
2. Burkitt's lymphoma (BL): 11 samples  
3. neuroblastoma (NB): 18 samples  
4. rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS): 25 samples  

```Total number of samples: 83```  
```Total number of genes: 2308```

2. normal lung (NL): 17 samples  
3. small cell lung cancer (SMCL): 6 samples  
4. squamous cell carcinoma (SQ): 21 samples  
5. pulmonary carcinoid (COID): 20 samples  

```Total number of samples: 203```  
```Total number of genes: 12600```
